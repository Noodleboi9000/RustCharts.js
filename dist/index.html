                Displayed above is two graphs, the line graph demonstrates the year on the X axis and player count on the Y axis. 
                The bar graph is displaying again the year on the x axis and the amount of updates released during each year on the Y axis.

                Using this infomation we can draw certain conculsions about Rust. Firstly the game has experienced year on year player base growth, with a large spike in 2021.
                Of course the reason for the spike in growth during 2021 is due to lockdowns giving people more free time, however, once lockdown lifts the playerbase
                drops. Notably after the drop in players the game has a substantial uptake in players not consistent with the trend before 2021.

                The data indicates that the first four years of Rust's life had nearly double the amount of updates per year compared to that of 2018 and beyond.
                Although we don't have all the data necessary on hand to draw a solid conculsion as to why this is the case, we know that Rust had not received its full release
                until Febuary of 2018. With this knowledge we can speculate that the amount of updates per year previously to 2018 were in an effort to get the game ready for 
                it's full release. <p id="pTag">Loading...</p>
